                these works highlight my variety of abilities and skills in computer science that i have developed over the years. 
                Below are some of my most notable projects that either display my skills or have had a major impact on my journey.</h4>

                    <h2>Isopod Adventure</h2>
                    <p>Isopod Adventure was the first project i ever worked on and the project that started my journey in computer science.
                        It was originally a piece of homework for my GCSE computer science course, back in 2016, where i was tasked to make a simple text based adventure. 
                        However, i found myself wanting to go further than the original requirements 
                        and pushed myself to add simple turn based combat and random choices before the homework deadline.
                    </p>
                    <p>Looking back on the code i can see many ways i could improve it or make it more interesting
                        but it still holds a special place in my heart as the project that helped me discover my love of computer science.</p>

                    <h2>IBM App Competition</h2>
                    <p>Back when i was in year 9, the academy my secondary was part of hosted a competition in partner ship with IBM where all students 
                        in year 9 across all the schools had to pitch an app. The first round was just a written pitch of the idea behind the app. My group and another 
                        were the only groups to make it to round two where we had to create a video for our app. Then my group made it to the finals where we had to give a 
                        presentation to the staff of IBM and a tour of the office.
                    </p>
                    <p>While we didn't end up winning the experience taught me many valuable skills about working as a group and how to pitch an idea. The Competition also served to
                        widen my interest in not just programming but computer science as a whole. It also to showed me that i was capable of working in programming 
                        and that i am capable of contributing something meaningful.
